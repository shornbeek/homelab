<h1>What is Kit?</h1>

<h2 class="padding1">I wanted to put together a quick summary to help people better understand what Kit is and why Kit is important.</h2>

<!--<img class="container"   src="images/white.png" alt="Robot Or Man."> -->



 

<h2 class="padding1">At Kit HomeLab we loved the cloud so much that we wanted to build it! I was really overwhelmed by the amount of server options and parts. I looked for a server kit or a home lab bundle that I could purchase. I could not find an all in one network that meet my needs so I built Kit. 
</h2> 

<h2 class="padding1">Kit is a powerful home network that also has room to grow.</h2>

<h2 class="padding1">I spent endless nights searching for server components that would work with my network. I found it to be really fun and educational! But as I tried to talk with other people about servers and the cloud I would get little enthusiasm. Mostly because people really did not understand the topic.</h2>
  
  <h2 class="padding1">The issue with servers and home networks is that people either get really overpowered equipment or they purchase at a hot deal that is quickly maxed out or outdated.</h2> 

  <h2 class="padding1">I had no desire to build out a large 24u or 48u rack. But I did want to understand rack servers, homelabs, and how the cloud really works. Google, AWS, and AZUR cloud is built on rack servers and blade servers. The blade enclosure is costly so I focused on how to make the best rack server possible.</h2> 
 

 <h2 class="padding1">Kit puts the power of cloud servers like aws right into your hands giving you more control over your data. Kit provides powerful computing power only seen in large data centers.</h2> 


  <h2 class="padding1">Our use of the 1u HP Proliant DL360 server allows Kit to be thin and powerful. A second 1u shelf holds all your network equipment; including your switch and modem. Kit also has 2u of open space that can be customized to hold additional equipment like more servers, switches, or firewalls.</h2> 


<h2 class="padding1">Thats how Kit was invented out of the need to learn about server used in the cloud. Kit home servers use a range of processing power between 2.5 - 2.9 gh and 128gm of memory. Kit is a great foundation to learn how powerful enterprise systems work. </h2> 

<h2 class="padding1">If your into Servers, and Home Networks but still need to stick to a tight budget Kit HomeLab is a great solution. For under 6k you can have all the components to build the cloud right in your home. </h2> 

<h2 class="padding1">Thanks for your time,</h2>
