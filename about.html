<h1>Kit brings the cloud to You!</h1>

<h2 class="padding1">I wanted to put together a quick summery to help people better understand what kit is and why Kit important.</h2>

<!--<img class="container" Â  src="images/white.png" alt="Robot Or Man."> -->



 

<h2 class="padding1">At Kit HomeLab we loved the cloud so much that we wanted to build it!  I was really over whelmend by the amount of server options and parts. I looked for a server kit or a home lab bundle that I could purchase. I could not find a system that meet my needs so I built Kit. Its a powerfull home network that also has room to grow!</h2> 

  
  <h2 class="padding1">The issue with servers and home networks is that people either get really over powered equipment or they find what they purchased at a hot deal is now outdated and not preforming because its over extended. </h2> 

  <h2 class="padding1">I had no desire to build out a large 24u or 48u rack. But i did want to understand rack servers, homelabs, and how the cloud really works. The Google AWS and AZUR cloud is built on rack servers and blade servers.  The blade inclosure is costly so I focused on how to make the best rack server possiable.</h2> 

 <h2 class="padding1"> Kit puts the power of cloud servers like aws right into your hands giving you more control over your data. Kit provides powerful computing power only seen in large data centers. </h2> 


  <h2 class="padding1">Our use of the 1u hp proliant dl360 server allows Kit to be thin and powerful. A second 1u shelf holds all your network equipment incoulding your switch and modum. Kit also has 2u of open space that can be customized to hold aditional equipment like more servers, switches, or firewalls.</h2> 

<h2 class="padding1">I spent endless nights searching for server components that would work with my network. I found it to be really fun and educational! But as I tried to talk with other people about servers and the cloud I would get little enthusiasm. Mostly because people really did not understand the topic. </h2> 

<h2 class="padding1">Thats how Kit was invented out of the need to learn about server used in the cloud.  Kit home servers use a range of processing power between 2.5 - 2.9 gh and 128gm of memory. Kit is a great foundation to learn how powerfull enterprise systems work. Everything can come pre assembled or we can send you all the components and you can set up kit with your technishion. </h2> 

<h2 class="padding1">If your into Servers, and Home Networks but still need to stick to a tight budget Kit HomeLab is a great solution. For under 6k you can have all the components to build the cloud right in your home. </h2> 

<h2 class="padding1">Thanks for your time,</h2> 

<h2 class="padding1">If you have any questions please contact me at stephen hornbeek@yahoo.com</h2>
