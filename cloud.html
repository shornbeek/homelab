<p class="p1">A / B. Home & Tower servers are great home solutions but they do not provide the memory and computing power that an enterprise rack servers provides.  Tower servers have no place to add the moduem and router if your building out your lab. </p>

<p class="p1">C. Rack servers can be costly and confusing. Rack systems and HomeLabs can be neverending and expnsive. Wrong parts are cominlly ordered. Configureations and wiring can look sloppy. The systems tend to be large. Most racks start at 12u and go as high as 48u. </p>

 <h2>Kit fills this gap between a large rack system and the low computing power of </h2>

After you find a server that you think fits your needs you need to install the sas drives and use the bios to add in an operating system. There is alos the setting up of the router and modum and hooking the switch up to the server and the aditional components to the switch.

Finding a server and seting up a network is complicated and time consuming but working with a home lab is so exciting! creating and building end to end solutions right from your home. 

Kit provides a great starting point for people that want to learn more about the cloud. 

Why 4u and 6u? If you looking into the rack and blade server markets you find huge 48U racks as the standared for data center. 48 U allows for the best utlization of space and the ability to scale the infastructure. There are almost 0 4u rack systems available becasue the current market demands. Scale and flexibility or compactness designed solutions for photos and other simple data are really your only options.

Kit home lab is for the person that wants to learn hands on about cloud computing and does not have the need to scale up to 48u size. Kit does give you the ability to grow. Kit has 2 aditional unused u's where you can add up to 2 more servers. giving you some serious hourse power. You can configure the aditional 2u'spacifically to your homelab needs. 

The tight package, pure power, and compact rack design makes kit the only full home network solution available in the market. 

The cloud is always changing and improving. Kit follows those trends and equipement is updated to reflect the current leaders in each industry.
